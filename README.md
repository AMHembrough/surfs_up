# Overview 

The purpose of the analysis was to provide the client with additional temperature data for the months of June and December on Oahu, thus enabling the client to better determine if the proposed surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

# Results: 

-	The mean temperature in June is nearly 75 degrees. 
-	The mean temperature in December is 71 degrees.  
-	Given the above two metrics, we can conclude that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round based on temperature-only analysis.

# Summary: 

## Results & Conclusions 

The results of the temperature analysis, utilizing 8 years of temperature data, suggests that Oahu average temperature ranges from 71-75 degrees Fahrenheit year-round.  In June, the coldest temperature Oahu experiences is 64 degrees, and the warmest temperature is 85 degrees.  In December, temperatures vary between 56 and 83 degrees.  The lack of extreme variability in temperature, even in the month of December, is suggestive that the proposed surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable. 

## Next Steps 

These data alone are not sufficient enough for our client, however.  I would recommend these additional queries before making any decisions regarding the proposed surg and ice cream shop.

-	A query that examines temperature data for all months, not just Dec.  I am not familiar with the weather patterns in Oahu enough to confirm that Dec is the coldest month.  I would suggest digging deeper into the weather data for the other winter months as well.
-	Another query I would suggest would examine sunny days.  What percentage of days are sunny in Oahu?
